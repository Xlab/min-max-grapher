## Abstract

A toolset written in java, oriented for visualization of structures from the MinMaxGD algebra.
This is a part of my **coursework 2012**.

This tool uses my [implementation of minmaxgd library in Java](https://github.com/Xlab/jminmaxgd).
It's a very specific topic, I couldn't explain anything in such a little space. Please refer to 

## Features

* Rendering elements of **MinMax[γ,δ]** in 2-dimensional domain;
* LaTeX rendering for analytic computations;
* Handy editor with full support of **Groovy** scripting language integrated.
