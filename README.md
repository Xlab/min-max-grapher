## Abstract

This is a part of my **coursework '2012**. Should be used with my [jminmaxgd library](https://github.com/Xlab/jminmaxgd).
It's a very specific topic, so don't try to realize anything.

## Features

* Rendering elements of "**Max in [γ,δ]**" in 2-dimensional domain;
* LaTeX rendering for analytic computations;
* Handy editor with full support of **Groovy** scripting language integrated.
